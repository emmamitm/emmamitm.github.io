## Project Description 

The Cache Simulator is a highly efficient software tool written using the C++ programming language and makes extensive use of the `unordered_map` data structure. This simulator attempts to emulate the behaviours of a computer system's cache memory, providing insights into computational memory management and efficiency.

The `unordered_map` is particularly suitable for our cache simulation since a cache can be thought of as a key-value paired data structure just like an `unordered_map`.

## Key Features

* Efficient insert and access operations: The `unordered_map` uses a hash table for storage, thus facilitating constant time complexity for these operations. 

* Extensive customizability: `unordered_map`'s template accepts parameters for the key, the mapped value, hash function, predicate function and allocator type. This versatility allows for diverse applications of the `unordered_map` in the cache simulation.

* Robust Constructors and Member functions: This header file includes a rounded set of constructors for creating a variety of maps and a comprehensive set of functions to interact with the data.




### Dependencies 
 C++ compiler installed that supports at least C++14.

### Running the Simulator 

To run the simulator, you must have a driver program that includes this `unordered_map` file and uses it to perform cache operations. The exact steps will depend on your project structure and compiler.
