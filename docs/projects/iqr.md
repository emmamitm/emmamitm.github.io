# LLIQR (Linked List Interquartile Range)
LLIQR is the C++ implementation of Interquartile Range (IQR) determination using a linked list. The IQR is a statistical range that measures the statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles. IQR is a measure of variability, based on dividing a data set into quartiles.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to start working with LLIQR.

    git clone https://github.com/[username]/InterquartileRange.git

## Dependencies
Make sure you have C++ compiler installed which is fully compliant with C++ standards. The software should be able to compile and run on any system with a modern C++ compiler.
## Building
You can build the LLIQR code with cmake. The build steps are as follows:

        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make 
## Code Structure
The main function locates in the root directory of the project in the main.cpp file.
